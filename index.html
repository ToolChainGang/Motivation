<article id="Overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Many people have difficulty bringing their projects to completion.
They get excited at first, but the passion soon fades and the
project languishes for lack of time.</p>
<p>
Then you get a new idea that seems wonderful and exciting, but in a little
while this new excitement also fades, and now you have two projects
languishing for lack of time.</p>
<p>Rinse, and repeat.</p>
<p>
Over time, many people amass multiple, sometimes dozens, of projects
that they recognize as valuable, and would "really like to get back to", but
never seem to have the time or motivation to do so.</p>

<p>
This program uses psychological methods to increase your motivation for completing projects.
Run it once a day for 30 days, and you should see an improvement in project motivation.</p>
<p>
Each run consists of a one-minute slideshow of words and images that bring your project to mind,
plus a short lesson on some aspect of motivation.</p>
<p>
The slideshow gets your mind thinking about the project, and the lessons help you make
small changes to your behavior and attitude that should boost your project motivation.</p>
<p>
The techniques are documented and backed by scientific studies, no tricks or subliminal
messaging is used. The techniques are described in the "Methods" link on the main page.</p>

<article id="Overview2">
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="HWord">Q: Does this work?<br>&nbsp;<br>
A: No one knows.</p>
<p>
The premise of this program is that extrinsic goals have replaced your intrinsic motives,
and your intrinsic motives have faded. That this happens is well established in the literature.</p>
<p>
What isn't known, because it hasn't been studied, is whether this situation
can be reversed. Hence this program.</p>
<p>It's 5 minutes of your time each morning for 30 days.</p>
<p>Try it, it's experimental, and if it doesn't work
you're no worse off than you were at the start.</p>

<!-- Slideshow ##################################################################################################### -->

<article id="SSDay1">
<h2>Welcome to motivation!</h2>
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<p>This is your first day.</p>
<p>
It starts with a slideshow, where words and images appear on the
screen. This takes about a minute, and uses
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming</a>
to get you to think about your project.</p>
<p>
During the slideshow, one of the words will stand out: it might be in
color, or a different position, or upside down, or outlined, or shaking... something
will be different and it will be easy to spot.</p>
<p>
After the slide show you will be asked to identify the standout word. If you didn't notice
which word was emphasized you'll have to rewatch the slideshow.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('SSDay1a')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="SSDay1a">
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
Once you've identified the standout word, you'll be shown the lesson
text and maybe asked to do a small task.</p>
<p>
The lessons are short (less then 5 min), the tasks are simple,
and not all days have lessons, so the course shouldn't take much of your time.</p>
<p>In fact, this first day doesn't have a lesson. Lessons start on day two.</p>
<p>
At the end of the course, after 30 days of running this program, you should have better
motivation to finish your project.</p>

<p>Running the course multiple times per day will give a stronger effect</p>
<p class="CenterText">...but don't overdo it.</p>
<p>
Three times a day is good, but more than five is
probably too much.</p>
<p>Also, it's better to let some time elapse between runs. Running
the program once in the morning, afternoon, and night will be better than running
it three times in the morning.</p>
<p>Your brain needs to process and integrate the information, which usually happens during sleep.</p>

<!-- Two types of motivation ####################################################################################### -->

<article id="TWA00">
<h2>Extrinsic and Intrinsic Motivation</h2>
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations are what you get for completing a project, such as money, fame, encouragement,
likes, subscribers, or avoiding punishment. They are the rewards you get in exchange for being done.</p>
<p>
<b>Intrinsic</b> motivations come from the project itself, and there are four types:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Autonomy</span> - You decide what to do</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you&nbsp;re rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('TWA01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="TWA01">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>routine, repetitive</em> tasks - things you can do automatically,
without a lot of thought or planning.<br>&nbsp;<br>
For example, a dealership auto mechanic spends his day diagnosing
and fixing one brand of cars. The procedures are well known, require little thought or
choice, and the paycheck is his extrinsic reward.</p>
<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>creative</em> tasks.<br>&nbsp;<br>
If that same mechanic works at home on a project race car, he has
intrinsic motivations:</p>
<ul class="NoSpc">
<li>He chooses what to do, and how to do it.</li>
<li>He learns about a different class of vehicle</li>
<li>He does a good job, and the car looks good</li>
<li>He wants to start racing</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on his a project car, the mechanic gains a deep sense of satisfaction.<br>&nbsp;<br>
He enjoys the process.</p>

<article id="TWA02">
<h2>Homework:</h2>
<p>
Before the next course day, when you get a moment, think about your project and choose the
intrinsic motivation your project is weakest on.</p>
<p>
Don't spend a lot of time on this, just think about the question when you have spare moments.
Have your choice ready for the next lesson.</p>
<p>For reference, the intrinsic motivations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Autonomy</span> - You make the decisions</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>

<h2>Decreasing motivation</h2>
<p>Extrinsic motivations will decrease the intrinsic motivations.</p>
<p>
In one study, nursery school students were given markers and encouraged to draw pictures
during their free play time, an activity for which they had high intrinsic interest.</p>
<p>
Several weeks later, students in one group were given a “good player”
award with a ribbon and gold star for drawing, while students in the control group were simply
encouraged to draw for fun.
Several weeks after that, both groups were monitored when the markers were brought out
during playtime.</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, children given an extrinsic reward showed far less interest in drawing
than the children who were not offered the reward.</p>
<p>Something about the reward reduced the children’s desire to draw.</p>

<p>In the second phase, one group was paid for the activity, while the second group acted as a control.</p>
<p>In the third phase, both groups once again performed the activity with no rewards.</p>
<p>
Students who were paid during the second phase were less likely to continue the
activities in the third phase. Students who were not paid were more likely to continue.</p>
<p>
Both groups started out equally interested, but the extrinsic reward reduced the motivation
for one group.</p>

<h2>The Overjustification Effect</h2>
<p>
This is called the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect">
overjustification effect</a>.</p>
<p>
Essentially, your mind notices being rewarded for an activity, and assumes
this is the reason you're doing it. Extrinsic motivations replace your 
intrinsic ones, and the intrinsic motivations fade.</p>
<p>But then, the extrinsic rewards only come when the project is complete...</p>
<p>
So with no intrinsic motivation to sustain you, making progress on your projects
becomes a boring drudgery. You lose interest over time, and eventually give up.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble finishing your projects, probably your
intrinsic motivations have been replaced with extrinsic ones, leaving no
motivation to sustain you while working on your project.</p>
<p>You'll need to fix that.</p>

<h2>Defining your motivations</h2>
<p>
To refocus on intrinsic motivations, start by writing them down.</p>
<p>
On a piece of paper, list all the motivations you have for your project.</p>
<p>Put the internal motivations in four sections at the top, and keep the external
rewards in a separate section below.</p>

<h2>Actions can change Beliefs</h2>
<p>Your actions can change your beliefs.</p>
<p>In one study researchers had two groups perform a boring
task for an hour. Subjects from the first group were then asked to convince
another person (an actor) that the task was interesting and engaging, while 
the second group acted as a control.</p>
<p>
Curiously, subjects who tried to convince a third person that the task was
actually interesting rated the tasks less boring than the subjects in the
control group.</p>
<p>
Their brains noticed a disconnect between their beliefs and their actions, and
changed their beliefs to become consistent.</p>

<h2>Concordant self-image</h2>

In another study, when participants were asked to give an impromptu speech supporting
an opinion they disagreed with, their private opinion moved closer to the opinion in the

Again, it seems that their brains noticed the disconnect between what they believed and
how they acted, and changed beliefs to make a more consistent self image.</p>
<p>
Your brain tries to maintain a concordant self-image. When your actions are
inconsistent with your beliefs, your mind will change beliefs to match your actions.

Mantras get a lot of bad press, and probably for good reason. They are used for
all sorts of vague and sketchy reasons, with a strong mystical component.

Nothing long, just a couple of words. It can be generic,

writing detective novels".</p>

Use personal pronouns and put your verb in present tense. Starting with "I"

A mantra should also be positive, in the logical sense. don't say "I don't"
or "I won't", brains have a harder time with inverted logic.
Phrase it in terms of what you <em>will</em> do, instead of what you won't.

Some projects are a mixture of both.</p>

Sanding and painting might not be as interesting as the engine rebuild.</p>

You can also try switching motivations. This can work if a long, boring task
comes in the middle. When you reach the boring task, switch from intrinsic motivations
to extrinsic ones.</p>
<p>
Promise yourself a reward for successful completion: go out to dinner, eat a bowl of ice cream,
take a walk in the park - whatever you enjoy, use that as a reward for finishing the
boring section.</p>
<p>
Keep your task motivations separate. Any overlap between the rewards and
the enjoyment will reduce your enjoyment.</p>
<p>
Be clear with yourself that the rewards are for completing the task, and not for
the entire project. Think about the rest of the project in terms of intrinsic enjoyment.</p>

<h2>The neurochemistry of motivation</h2>
<p>
Knowing the neurochemistry of motivation can help. Knowing how things work and how they
interrelate will help you make informed decisions about your motivation.</p>
<p>
The next few lessons describe, in broad terms, how the brain manages motivation
using neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors.</p>
<p>
The scientific literature for neurochemistry has changed since the author first 
learned it 10 years ago. It's also wildly complex, and there's no consensus.</p>
<p>
What follows is believed to be accurate for <em>what</em> happens and can be used
for illustration and planning, but the names might be wrong.</p>

<article id="NCA01">
<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>
<p>Neurotransmitters are chemicals that one neuron uses to signal another. </p>
<p class="NoTop">
This happens at a special point called a synapse, where one neuron
almost touches another. When the neuron wants to send a signal, it
releases neurotransmitter molecules at the synapse, which diffuse to the
other neuron and bind to corresponding receptors.</p>
<div>
<img class="BigImageLeft" alt="Synapse diagram" src="images/Synapse.gif">
<div class="RightText1">
<br>
It's sort of like ringing a desk bell. Sending neurotransmitter molecules
through the synapse alerts the target neuron.<br>&nbsp;<br>
After the signal is delivered, the molecules drift back to the source neuron
where they are collected and stored for future signaling.

The brain uses over 100 different neurotransmitters, but we only need to
know about three: norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The brain uses these for effort, enjoyment, and reward.</p>
<br>
<table class="CenterDiv"><tbody>
<tr>
    <td>Norepinephrine</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

<h2>Norepinephrine is effort</h2>
<p>The first neurotransmitter of interest is norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter of effort.</p>
<p>
You may have heard of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline (two words for the same
substance). It's the chemical in
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector">EpiPens</a>
used to treat severe allergic reaction.</p>
<p>
Epinephrine is released when you're afraid or angry, and
causes your heart to race, your blood pressure to
rise, and releases glucose into the blood for quick energy.
It prepares your body (and mind) for a jolt of activity:
fight or flight, something you might have to do to survive.</p>
<p>
Nor-epinephrine, also known as
nor-adrenaline (again: two words, same substance),
is a weaker version used for day-to-day actions. Each time you decide
to do (or not to do) something, your brain uses norepinephrine/noradrenaline.</p>
<p>If you've heard the expression "burning the candle at both ends", nor-epinephrine is
like burning a candle, and epinephrine is like burning rocket fuel.</p>

<h2>The effort threshold</h2>
<p>
When your brain decides to act, it releases norepinephrine and
starts a counter to monitor the amount used for the task.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When the norepinephrine exceeds a threshold limit, the counter generates frustration,
irritation, dissatisfaction, and annoyance to encourage the brain to stop.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Here are two tasks showing the counter limit.</p>
<div>
<img class="BigImageLeft" alt="Epinephrine counter diagram" src="images/NorEpi.png">
<div class="RightText1">
<p>
The first task requires many actions. The total
norepinephrine exceeds the limit, resulting in frustration and annoyance.
The brain quits before reaching the goal.</p>
<p>
The second task is less demanding. Using fewer and easier actions, the
goal is reached before the threshold limit.</p>

package? Better knowledge about something? Would a special jig to hold the workpiece

<h2>Dopamine is enjoyment</h2>
<p>The second neurotransmitter (of three) is dopamine, the neurotransmitter of enjoyment.

<h2>Leaving things undone</h2>
<p>
One way to make starting easier is to leave something undone.</p>
<p>
Writers sometimes do this. Instead of taking a break when a chapter is finished,
they stop a half page <em>before</em> the end of a chapter, or after
the first page of the <em>next</em> chapter.</p>
<p>
When they sit down again, the next paragraphs are obvious, the
dopamine kicks in, and they continue.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble starting a project session, try leaving something
undone in the previous session. Install all the bolts except one, don't sew
the last hem, leave 1 component unplaced on the board layout, and so on.</p>
<p>

<h2>Serotonin is reward</h2>
<p>
The third and final neurotransmitter is serotonin, which the
brain uses for changes in predicted reward.</p>
<p>
Serotonin increases your dopamine when something unexpectedly favorable happens, 
and decreases it when something unexpectedly bad happens.</p>
<p>
(Note: This function exists in your brain, and serotonin exists in your brain, 
but assigning this function to serotonin is probably incorrect.
There's currently no consensus on what serotonin does, so I'll use the term
for now and correct it later.)</p>

Studies show</a>
that a year after winning the lottery, people return to
the level of happiness they had before winning.</p>
<p>
Studies also show that after a tragic life event (cancer,
losing a limb), people generally return their level of happiness
from before the event.</p>
<p>
There seems to be a baseline level of happiness people get from
their daily lives: from a rewarding job, raising kids, having a life partner, 
or generally when they feel their life is "on the right track".
<p>
Life brings with it a default level of dopamine.</p>

There is also an adjustment mechanism: the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27069377/">
dopamine reward prediction error</a>.</p>
<p>When you consider an action, the brain looks forward in time and
predicts the reward for achieving that goal. You get
a dopamine release for that predicted reward.</p>
<p>Once the goal is reached, the actual reward is compared to the predicted
reward: if extra reward is seen, serotonin encourages more dopamine
saying, in effect, "next time have a more positive outlook".</p>
<p>If less reward than predicted is seen, serotonin causes dopamine to be
withheld, reducing future predictions.</p>
<p>
This feedback teaches our brain to make accurate predictions.</p>

Prediction error is differential: it measures perceived
<em>differences</em> in value.</p>
<p>
Sudden jumps will change the base dopamine level, but permanent rewards
will become less noticeable over time.</p>
<p>
A pay raise makes you happy because the extra reward is different
from what you used to get, but the feeling soon fades. A year later
the perceived value is the same as the day before, and will be the
same a day later, and you find yourself looking for another pay raise.</p>
<p>
Lottery winners feel joy from the increased dopamine. A year
later, the perceived value is the same as the previous day, the same
as predicted for the next day, and the dopamine kick
has faded. They've returned to their original level of happiness.</p>

<p>
If you haven't gotten back to your project, now would be a good time.
You'll get a stronger effect if you can identify where future lessons
apply to your specific project.</p>
<p>
This reflects a more general principle: Learning is easier when your
brain can associate it with one of your goals.</p>
<p>
If you are taking a course, one way to make the learning easier is
to consider a project that would benefit from the knowledge
You don't need to start the project, or even intend to start the
project for this to have an effect.</p>
<p>
Just outline something you could do, some concrete thing you could construct
that would have value, then use the course as a guide to building it.</p>

<h2>The Perceptual Filter</h2>
<p>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_formation#Ascending_reticular_activating_system">
Reticular Activating System</a> (hereafter: RAS) is the brain's perceptual
filter. It stands between your sensations and conscious
mind, and decides what is important.</p>
<p>
As you read this, you can feel your clothes against your skin and your weight against
the chair. You see the room beyond the display, hear background noise,
and feel the temperature of the air.</p>
<p>None of this makes it to your conscious mind because the RAS
decides that it's not important.</p>
<p>
...yet a bug crawling up your leg would grab your attention.
The RAS sounds the alarm, saying: "check this out now!"</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('RSA01')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="RSA01">
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
The RAS filters both sensations and perceptions. For example,
chatting with your neighbor you hear:</p>
<p class="Conversation">
Garden is doing well, had to have our elderly cat put down, son is joining the air
force, we're selling his car, the house needs painting, getting an estimate
tomorrow, our daughter is getting married...</p>
<p>
Now suppose you are in the market for a car. You know roughly the type, model, age, and
mileage you want, and you're planning to visit a dealership this weekend.</p>

That same conversation:</p>
<p class="Conversation">
Garden is doing well, had to have our elderly cat put down, son is joining the air
force, <span class="Bold">we're selling his car</span>, the house needs painting,
getting an estimate tomorrow, our daughter is getting married...</p>
<p>
You ask: Oh? What kind of car? How much are you asking?</p>
<p>
You find that her son's car matches your needs, it's a good price,
they're reliable sellers, so you make an offer.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
In the first conversation, nothing stood out because your RAS decided
none of it would help your goals.</p>
<p>
In the second example the mention of a car stands out. The RAS alerts your conscious mind
to the possibility of relevance, you inquired further, and found that it satisfies your
goals.</p>
<p>
The RAS is part of the brain's goal seeking mechanism.</p>
<p>
Our daily lives are awash in possibilities, things we see, things we hear, things
of benefit we could look into, that go unnoticed because the RAS decides
they aren't relevant.</p>
<p>
When we set clear goals, our RAS alerts us when possibilities arise, 
which leads to more chances at success.</p>

<article id="RSB01">
<h2>Goal Setting</h2>
<p>
There are many theories of
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_setting">Goal Setting</a>,
but in general goals should be:</p>
<ul class="CenterDiv RAS">
<li>Personal</li>
<li>Present</li>
<li>Positive</li>
<li>Measurable (if possible)</li>
<li>Time limited (if possible)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Personal</h3>
You can only set an RAS goal for yourself, not others. This may seem obvious,
but it's surprising how many people try to set goals for their kids.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Use an "I" or "My" statement as a goal. Something
like "I paint the hallway" or "I rebuild my engine".
<h3>Present</h3>
The RAS is an older part of the brain, evolutionarily speaking. It has an
easier time when goals are expressed in the present tense.
<p>
Instead of "I will build a robot", use "I build a robot". Visualize
the action in the present, instead of an indeterminate future date.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('RSB02')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="RSB02">
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<h3>Positive</h3>
<p>
Keep your goals positive, in a logical sense. Set goals
for what you <em>will</em> do, not what you <em>won't</em>.</p>
<p>
The RAS, as an older part of the brain, has difficulty with 
reversed logic.</p>
<h3>Measurable</h3>
If possible, express your goals in a measurable way.
<p>
Your brain perceives goal as a journey. Measurable progress
makes the goal seem more journey-like, which is what your
norepinephrine/dopamine system is evolved for.</p>
<h3>Time Limited</h3>
If possible, set a reasonable end date, and track your progress
over time to the end date.
<p>
This also makes the goal appear as a journey, which will better
resonate with your RAS.</p>

A pad and pen (or pencil) is better suited to this than

<!-- Failure ####################################################################################################### -->

<article id="FAI00">
<h2>Ignoring Failure</h2>
<p>Thomas Edison famously made over 10,000 failed attempts before he got a working
light bulb.</p>
<p>
When asked by a reporter how it felt to fail 10,000 times, Edison replied:
“I didn't fail 10,000 times, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that will not work.”</p>
<p>
This lesson isn't about motivation <em>now</em>, it's
about keeping motivation when you encounter a failure.</p>
<p>
Imagining future failures can minimize their impact.
Also, thinking about failure can encourage taking steps to avoid it.</p>
<p>
Note the word "when" and not "if" above. It's a near certainty
that you'll encounter failure at some point, and getting properly
oriented beforehand will help.</p>
<p>The term for this is
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospection">"prospection"</a>.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>So then, how should we handle failure?
<br>&nbsp;<br>
First, note that failure comes at the end of a project, or perhaps causes the end.
If you're still trying, if there's still a way it might work, then you haven't failed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Next, in almost all cases failure is a stepping stone to success. There are innumerable
examples of people failing repeatedly, only to succeed in the end. Thomas Edison is
an extreme example (10,000 tries? Yikes!), but the principle is everywhere.<br>&nbsp;<br>
And finally, even when a project fails, is it a complete failure?<br>&nbsp;<br>
Consider:</p>
<ul class="CenterDiv">
<li>Did you learn anything new?</li>
<li>Did you improve your technique?</li>
<li>Can you salvage something useful for another project?</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's extremely rare for a project to fail completely.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
In nearly all cases there is value in having made the journey.</p>

<article id="FLO00">
<h2>Flow States</h2>
<p>
A <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow state</a>
is when you're doing something and you lose track of time. Many people experience flow states while driving:
you're thinking about something, turning over a problem in your mind, and arrive at your
destination with no memory of driving or of the passage of time.</p>
<p>
Some people experience flow states in their projects. They sit down to work, get caught up in the
activity, and look up hours later wondering where the time went.</p>
<p>
Flow states are enjoyable, and the enjoyment builds the longer you are in the state. When you enter
flow, it's as if your brain starts a counter, and the higher the count the more pleasure you
get. When you stop working, the counter resets to zero, and if you restart your counter needs to
build back up before you can get a similar level enjoyment.</p>
<p>
The flow state counter will reset every time you stop working, so for maximum pleasure you can
seek to avoid interruptions and breaks while in a flow state.</p>

<!-- Cognitive Gas Tank ############################################################################################ -->

<article id="COG00">
<h2>The Cognitive Gas Tank</h2>
<p>
One curious result from psychological studies is that cognition is a limited resource.</p>
<p>
It's as if you wake up each morning with a gas tank full of cognitive ability, and throughout the day
every action you take and every decision you make uses up a little bit of it.</p>
<p>
During sleep, your gas tank fills up so that, hopefully, you wake up refreshed, with a full tank.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('COG01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="COG01">
<p>
Studies show that it's possible to drain your cognition completely, and when that happens you lose
the ability to make rational decisions.</p>
<p>
This explains how you can come home at night and feel exhausted, even though you know you're not
physically tired. Your cognitive gas tank is sitting at empty, and all you want to do is veg out
in front of the T.V.</p>

<article id="COG02">
<p>
It's OK to feel exhausted at the end of the day occasionally - we're probably evolved for that -
but if you're feeling exhausted every evening then that should be fixed. Constant mental exhaustion
is the same as constant mental stress (it uses the same neurotransmitters), and this causes incremental
damage.</p>
<p>
It causes depression, reduces your immune function, and leads to all sorts of problems later
in life.</p>
<p>
It's sort of like smoking. The damage from a single cigarette probably won't affect your health
appreciably, but smoking continually over several years and the damage will add up.</p>

<!-- Tuning ######################################################################################################## -->

<article id="TUA00">
<h2>Tuning your project</h2>
<p>Your brain is a goal-seeking system.</p>
<p>
Once you choose a destination, your brain mechanisms work to get you there, in
opposition to other mechanisms that encourage you to stop.</p>
<p>
We can increase our project enjoyment by tuning our projects to more strongly
resonate with these mechanisms.</p>
<p>There's a tremendous payoff for doing this.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('TUA01')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="TUA01">
<h2>Eliminate pain</h2>
<p>
The first and most important way to increase your enjoyment is to eliminate pain.</p>
<p>
All of it.</p>
<p>
Pain feeds directly into the norepinephrine counter in your brain: it makes you
want to stop whatever it is that you're doing.</p>
<p>
Dopamine is literally an analgesic, which means it will mask the sensation of pain.
You can burn yourself soldering, scrape a knuckle removing a stuck bolt, cut
yourself with an x-axto knife... and never realize it. Often times, it's only
hours later that you start to feel the pain, notice the injury, and wonder
"when did I do this?"</p>
<p>
Your dopamine caused you to ignore it.</p>
<p>
Of course, if the pain then becomes more insistent it will reach a level that
can overwhelm the dopamine effect and you are forced to stop.</p>

<article id="TUA02">
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
As a general rule of thumb, you should be able to work on your project for
10 hours without pain.</p>
<p>
If after a couple of hours you find that your joints are stiff, your neck is
sore, your back is bothering you... adjust your work area.</p>
<p>
The biggest offender here is back ache, which is caused by being bent over
for long periods and fixed by raising your work area so that you aren't bent over.</p>
<p>
Lathe operators typically hunch over their work, only to find a couple of days
later that their back is bothering them, and are on disability a few weeks later.</p>
<p>
Raise the lathe 4 inches and the back problems go away.</p>

<article id="TUA04">
<h2>Homework</h2>
<p>
For the next few sessions, keep a journal of all the pains you have while working
on your project.</p>
<p>
Dopamine will make you forget about these, so you'll need a way to remind
yourself to do this.</p>
<p>
Take a composition notebook and describe how you feel at the end of your
project sessions. Place the journal so that you have to encounter it at the
end of the session: put your car keys inside the journal when you start, or
put the journal on your stove so you have to move it to make dinner, put it
over the light switch... whatever you need to remind yourself to make
a journal entry when you stop.</p>
<p>
Do this for 7 days of project, and see if you can identify any constant
aches and pains: back ache, neck ache, eye strain - whatever.</p>
<p>
After 7 entries (or perhaps before), look over what you've written
and see if there are any ways to improve.</p>
<p>
This isn't a mental technique, so it's OK to enter into the computer.</p>

<h2>Priming</h2>
<p>
Priming is when a stimulus raises the brain's awareness of related concepts.</p>
<p>
An example should make this clear. Read the following passage, then answer the
question on the next page.</p>
<p id="Shoes">
<em>For my money, there was never a better shoe than the Anaheim sneaker.
Whatever the surface or the size of the arena, any time a short-sided
game crept up, you would find me wearing Anaheims. Mid-rise collar for stability
and a natural fit for small feet, elastic laces and hook & loop closure made
it easy to get on and off. Traction, cushioning, and the overall feel
provided excellent grip on any surface.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The biggest issue for me was an odd fit/looseness in the heel. 
This happened every time I put the shoes on, but it went away
after a few minutes of use.</em></p>
<p>
Hint: It helps to read the passage aloud. See if you can discover
It's odd nature.</p>

<article id="NotePa">
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
Think of a 4-letter word beginning with S, O, L.</p>
<p>
When you have one, type a letter to enter your word.</p>
<p class="CenterDiv">
SOL<input id="PrimeLetter" type="text" maxlength="1" onkeydown="return NavPrim(event)">

<div id="NotePa1" class="Hidden">

People typically guess "SOLD", since it is the most common.</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, people who first read the shoe passage often answer "SOLE".
The paragraph primes shoe related concepts in the brain,
even though "SOLE" did not appear in the paragraph, even as a substring.</p>
<p>Priming activated the related concept.</p>
<p>
You are now primed. Shoe related items are now emphasized in your brain, and
this will affect your decisions and actions until the effect wears off.</p>

Priming fades with time, but there is no consensus for how long it lasts. Some
studies claim it decays over a few hours, but others have shown a small effect
measurable a week after the original stimulus.</p>
<p>
There are also different types of priming, and it is not known if the different types
have different durations.</p>

The slideshow uses priming to get your mind thinking about the project.
We show images and words related to your project, and repeat this daily for a

<h2>The Standout Word</h2>
<p>

<p>
The "standout word" is just a mechanism to keep you focused. it's not counted
or scored.</p>

The type of highlighting is randomly determined - the idea is that if you don't
know which word will stand out, you'll pay attention. Similarly, the number
of standouts and type of question can vary.</p>
