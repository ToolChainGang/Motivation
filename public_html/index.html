<!-- Two types of motivation ####################################################################################### -->

<article id="MOA00">
<h2>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</h2>

<p><b>Extrinsic</b> motivations are what you get for completing a project, such as money, fame, encouragement,
likes, subscribers, or avoiding punishment. They are the rewards you get for finishing.
</p>

<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations come from the project itself, in these categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You decide what to do</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('MOA01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="MOA01">
<p><b>Extrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>routine, repetitive</em> tasks - things you can do automatically,
without a lot of thought or planning.
</p>
<p>For example, a dealership auto mechanic spends his day diagnosing
and fixing a specific brand of cars. The procedures are well known, require little thought or
choice, and the paycheck is his extrinsic reward.
</p>

<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>creative</em> tasks.
</p>
<p>If that same mechanic goes home to work on a project race car, he will use
intrinsic motivations:</p>

<ul class="NoSpc">
<li>He chooses what to do, and how to do it.</li>
<li>He learns about a different type of vehicle</li>
<li>He does a good job, and the car looks good</li>
<li>He wants to start racing</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on his a project car, the mechanic gains a deep sense of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>He enjoys the process.
</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('MOA02')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="MOA02">
<p>Before the next course day, when you get a moment, think about your project and decide which
of the intrinsic motivations your project is weakest on.
</p>

<p>Don't spend a lot of time on this, just think about the question when you have spare moments
over the course of the day. Have your choice ready for the next session.
</p>

<p>For reference, the intrinsic motivations are:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You make the decisions</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>
</ul>

<!-- Neurochemistry of motivation ################################################################################## -->

<article id="NCA00">
<h2>The neurochemistry of motivation</h2>

<p>Knowing the neurochemistry of motivation can help. Knowing how things work and how they interrelate can help
you make changes that will work, instead of making changes based on guesswork.
</p>
<p>The following pages describe, in broad terms, how the brain manages motivation using neurotransmitters
and neuroreceptors. We start with a quick overview of these concepts.
</p>
<p>If you already know about neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors, you can skip the overview and start
with the section on motivation.
</p>
<p>If you don't know what neurotransmitters are, or you would like a refresher, start with that section.
That section will automatically lead into the motivation section after.

<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>

<p>Neurotransmitters are chemicals that a neuron uses to signal another neuron. 
</p>

<p>This signalling happens at a special point called a "synapse" on the neuron body - it's a place where the
body of one neuron almost touches the body of another. Whenever one neuron wants to signal another, it releases
neurotransmitter molecules at the synapse junction. The molecules diffuse over to the other neuron and bind to the
corresponding receptor, sending a signal that excites the target neuron.
</p>

<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('NCA02')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="NCA02">
<p>Once the signal is delivered, the target neuron releases the neurotransmitters. The molecules diffuse back
to the originating neuron, where they are collected and stored to use for future signaling.

<article id="NCA03">
<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>

<p>There are over 100 neurotransmitters used in the brain, but for our purposes we only need to know
about three: NorEpinephrine, Dopamine, and Serotonin, which are responsible for activity, pleasure,
and reward.
</p>

<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('NCA04')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="NCA04">
<p>Before we begin, we need to sort out some nomenclature.
</p>
<p>Adrenaline and Epinephrine are two names for the same chemical. It was discovered independently
by two laboratories at about the same time.
NorEpinephrine and NorAdrenaline are two names for a different chemical. It was
discovered by the same laboratories at about the same time.
</p>
<p>Epinephrine and NorEpinephrine are the names used in the US, while Adrenaline and NorAdrenaline are
used in the UK. Across the rest of the world different countries use one term or the other.
</p>
<p>Such is the way of science.
</p>
<p>For the rest of the course, this program will use both terms with a slash between the
equivalent names. Epinephrine/Adrenaline will be the "fight-or-flight" neurotransmitter, and
NorEpinephrine/NorAdrenaline will be the "action" neurotransmitter.

<h2>NorEpinephrine/NorAdrenaline, the neurotransmitter of action</h2>
<p>Adrenaline/Epinephrine prepares your body (and mind) for a jolt of activity:
fight or flight, something you might have to do to survive.
</p>
<p>NorAdrenaline/NorEpinephrine is a weaker version that's used for day-to-day decision
making. Every time you decide to do something (or not to do something), your brain uses
a little bit of Adrenaline/Epinephrine to start the action.
</p>
<p>You may have heard the expression "burning the candle at both ends".
</p>
<p>If NorAdrenaline/NorEpinephrine is like burning a candle, Adrenaline/Epinephrine
is like burning rocket fuel.

<!-- Failure ####################################################################################################### -->

<article id="FAL00">
<h2>Dealing with failure</h2>

<p>Thomas Edison famously made over 10,000 failed attempts before finally getting a working light bulb. When asked
by a reporter “How did it feel to fail 10,000 times?” Edison replied, “I didn't fail 10,000 times.
I’ve successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work.”
</p>

<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('FAL01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="FAL01">
<p>It's really more complicated than that.
</p>
<p>Success or failure is part of the rewards mechanism, which is governed by extrinsic
motivations. And as we have learned, extrinsic motivations play no part in whether we enjoyed
doing the project.
</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('FAL02')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>


<article id="FAL02">
<p>So how should we handle failure?
</p>
<p>Firstly, note that failure comes at the end, or perhaps causes the end of your project.
If you're still working, if you still see a way to proceed, then you haven't failed.
</p>
<p>Secondly, in almost all cases failure is a stepping stone to success. There are innumerable
examples of people failing over and over, only to succeed in the end. Thomas Edison is perhaps
an extreme example (10,000 tries - yikes!), but the principle is seen everywhere.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, even in the rare cases where a project fails, is it a complete failure?
</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you learn anything new?</li>
<li>Did you advance your technique?</li>
<li>Can you salvage something useful for another project?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's extremely rare for a project ro fail completely. In nearly all cases
there will still be some value in having made the journey.
</p>
<p>To summarize: <b>Don't be discouraged by failure.</b></p>

<!-- Flow ########################################################################################################## -->

<article id="FLO00">
<h2>Flow States</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">flow state</a> is when
you're doing something and you lose track of time. Many people experience flow states while driving
- you're thinking about something, turning over a problem in your mind, and arrive at your
destination without any memory of driving or of thepassage of time.
</p>
<p>Some people experience flow states in their projects. They sit down to work, get caught up in the
activity, and look up hours later wondering where the time went.
</p>
<p>Flow states are enjoyable, and the enjoyment builds the longer you are in the state. When you enter
flow, it's as if your brain starts a counter, and the higher the count the more pleasure you
get. When you stop working, the counter resets to zero, and if you restart your counter needs to
build back up before you can get a similar level enjoyment.
</p>
<p>The flow state counter will reset every time you stop working, so for maximum pleasure you can
seek to avoid interruptions and breaks while in a flow state.
