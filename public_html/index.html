<h2>Welcome to motivation!</h2>
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<p>This looks like your first time running the program.
</p>
<p>This first section consists of a slideshow, where words and images will appear on the
screen. This takes about a minute, and uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming</a>
to get you to think about your project.
</p>
<p>During the slideshow, one of the words will be somehow "emphasized": it might be in
color, or a different position, or upside down, or outlined, or shaking... something
will be different and it will be easy to spot.
</p>
<p>After the slide show you will be asked to identify the emphasized word. If you didn't see which
word was emphasized you'll have to rewatch the slideshow.

<p>Once you've correctly identified the emphasized word, you'll be shown some lesson text to read
and maybe asked to do a small task. The texts are short (less then 5 min), the tasks are simple,
and not all days have lessons, so the course shouldn't take up much of your time.
</p>
<p>At the end of the course - after 30 days of running this program - you should have better
motivation to finish your project.

probably too much. Also, it's better to let some time elapse between runs. Running
the program once in the morning, afternoon, and night will be better than running
it three times in the morning.

<!-- Two types of motivation ####################################################################################### -->

<article id="MOA00">
<h2>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</h2>

<p><b>Extrinsic</b> motivations are what you get for completing a project, such as money, fame, encouragement,
likes, subscribers, or avoiding punishment. They are the rewards you get for finishing.
</p>

<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations come from the project itself, in these categories:
</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You decide what to do</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('MOA01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="MOA01">
<p><b>Extrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>routine, repetitive</em> tasks - things you can do automatically,
without a lot of thought or planning.
</p>
<p>For example, a dealership auto mechanic spends his day diagnosing
and fixing a specific brand of cars. The procedures are well known, require little thought or
choice, and the paycheck is his extrinsic reward.
</p>

<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>creative</em> tasks.
</p>
<p>If that same mechanic goes home to work on a project race car, he has
intrinsic motivations:</p>

<ul class="NoSpc">
<li>He chooses what to do, and how to do it.</li>
<li>He learns about a different type of vehicle</li>
<li>He does a good job, and the car looks good</li>
<li>He wants to start racing</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on his a project car, the mechanic gains a deep sense of satisfaction.
</p>
<p>He enjoys the process.

<article id="MOA02">
<h2>Homework:</h2>
<p>Before the next course day, when you get a moment, think about your project and choose the
intrinsic motivation your project is weakest on.
</p>

<p>Don't spend a lot of time on this, just think about the question when you have spare moments.
Have your choice ready for the next lesson.
</p>

<p>For reference, the intrinsic motivations are:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You make the decisions</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>

<article id="NCA00">
<h2>The neurochemistry of motivation</h2>

<p>Knowing the neurochemistry of motivation can help. Knowing how things work and how they interrelate can help
you make changes that will work, instead of making changes based on guesswork.
</p>
<p>The following pages describe, in broad terms, how the brain manages motivation using neurotransmitters
and neuroreceptors. We start with a quick overview of these concepts.
</p>
<p>If you already know about neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors, you can skip the overview and start
with the section on motivation.
</p>
<p>If you don't know what neurotransmitters are, or you would like a refresher, start with that section.
That section will automatically lead into the motivation section after.

<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>

<p>Neurotransmitters are chemicals that a neuron uses to signal another neuron. 
</p>

<p>This signalling happens at a special point called a "synapse" on the neuron body - it's a place where the
body of one neuron almost touches the body of another. Whenever one neuron wants to signal another, it releases
neurotransmitter molecules at the synapse junction. The molecules diffuse over to the other neuron and bind to the
corresponding receptor, sending a signal that excites the target neuron.
</p>

<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('NCA02')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="NCA02">
<p>Once the signal is delivered, the target neuron releases the neurotransmitters. The molecules diffuse back
to the originating neuron, where they are collected and stored to use for future signaling.

<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>

<p>There are over 100 neurotransmitters used in the brain, but for our purposes we only need to know
about three: NorEpinephrine, Dopamine, and Serotonin, which are responsible for activity, pleasure,
and reward.
</p>

<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('NCA04')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="NCA04">
<p>Before we begin, we need to sort out some nomenclature.
</p>
<p>Adrenaline and Epinephrine are two names for the same chemical. It was discovered independently
by two laboratories at about the same time.
NorEpinephrine and NorAdrenaline are two names for a different chemical. It was
discovered by the same laboratories at about the same time.
</p>
<p>Epinephrine and NorEpinephrine are the names used in the US, while Adrenaline and NorAdrenaline are
used in the UK. Across the rest of the world different countries use one term or the other.
</p>
<p>Such is the way of science.
</p>
<p>For the rest of the course, this program will use both terms with a slash between the
equivalent names. Epinephrine/Adrenaline will be the "fight-or-flight" neurotransmitter, and
NorEpinephrine/NorAdrenaline will be the "action" neurotransmitter.

<h2>NorEpinephrine/NorAdrenaline, the neurotransmitter of action</h2>
<p>Adrenaline/Epinephrine prepares your body (and mind) for a jolt of activity:
fight or flight, something you might have to do to survive.
</p>
<p>NorAdrenaline/NorEpinephrine is a weaker version that's used for day-to-day decision
making. Every time you decide to do something (or not to do something), your brain uses
a little bit of Adrenaline/Epinephrine to start the action.
</p>
<p>You may have heard the expression "burning the candle at both ends".
</p>
<p>If NorAdrenaline/NorEpinephrine is like burning a candle, Adrenaline/Epinephrine
is like burning rocket fuel.

<!-- Failure ####################################################################################################### -->

<article id="FAI00">
<h2>Project Failure</h2>
<p>Imagining future failures can minimize their impact.
Also, thinking about failure can encourage taking steps to avoid it.</p>
<p>This lesson isn't about getting more motivation <em>now</em>, it's
about keeping motivation when you encounter a failure.
</p>
<p>Notice we said "when" and not "if" in the last line. It's nearly certain
that you'll encounter failure at some point, so getting properly
oriented beforehand will help.
</p>
<p>The term for this is "prospection", and there's a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospection">Wikipedia page</a> for it.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('FAI01')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="FAI01">
<h2>Dealing with failure</h2>
<p>Thomas Edison made more than 10,000 attempts before finally getting a working light bulb. When asked
by a reporter “How did it feel to fail 10,000 times?” Edison replied, “I didn't fail 10,000 times.
I’ve successfully found 10,000 ways that will not work.”
</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('FAI02')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="FAI02">
<p>So how should we handle failure?
</p>
<p>Firstly, note that failure comes at the end, or perhaps causes the end of your project.
If you're still working, if you still see a way to proceed, then you haven't failed.
</p>
<p>Secondly, in almost all cases failure is a stepping stone to success. There are innumerable
examples of people failing over and over, only to succeed in the end. Thomas Edison is perhaps
an extreme example (10,000 tries? Yikes!), but the principle is happens everywhere.
</p>
<p>Thirdly, even in the rare cases where a project fails, is it a complete failure?
</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you learn anything new?</li>
<li>Did you advance your technique?</li>
<li>Can you salvage something useful for another project?</li>
</ul>
<p>It's extremely rare for a project ro fail completely. In nearly all cases
there will still be some value in having made the journey.
</p>
<p>To summarize: <b>Don't be discouraged by failure.</b></p>

<article id="FLO00">
<h2>Flow States</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">flow state</a> is when
you're doing something and you lose track of time. Many people experience flow states while driving
- you're thinking about something, turning over a problem in your mind, and arrive at your
destination without any memory of driving or of thepassage of time.
</p>
<p>Some people experience flow states in their projects. They sit down to work, get caught up in the
activity, and look up hours later wondering where the time went.
</p>
<p>Flow states are enjoyable, and the enjoyment builds the longer you are in the state. When you enter
flow, it's as if your brain starts a counter, and the higher the count the more pleasure you
get. When you stop working, the counter resets to zero, and if you restart your counter needs to
build back up before you can get a similar level enjoyment.
</p>
<p>The flow state counter will reset every time you stop working, so for maximum pleasure you can
seek to avoid interruptions and breaks while in a flow state.
