<!-- Overview ###################################################################################################### -->

<article id="Overview">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Many people have difficulty bringing their projects to completion.
They get excited at first, but the passion soon fades and the
project languishes for lack of time.</p>
<p>
Then you get a new idea that seems wonderful and exciting, but in a little
while this new excitement also fades, and now you have two projects
languishing for lack of time.</p>
<p>Rinse, and repeat.</p>
<p>
Over time, many people amass multiple, sometimes dozens, of projects
that they recognize as valuable, and would "really like" to get back to, but they
never seem to have the time or motivation to do so.</p>

<p>
This program uses psychological methods to increase your motivation for completing projects.
Run it once a day for 30 days, and you should see an improvement in project motivation.</p>
<p>
Each run consists of a one-minute slideshow of words and images that bring your project to mind,
plus a short lesson on some aspect of motivation.</p>
<p>
The slideshow gets your mind thinking about the project, and the lessons help you make
small changes to your behavior and attitude that should boost your project motivation.</p>
<p>
The techniques are well documented and backed by scientific studies, no tricks or subliminal
messaging is used. All techniques are described in the "Methods" link on the main page.</p>

<article id="Overview2">
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p class="HWord">Q: Does this work?<br>&nbsp;<br>
A: No one knows.</p>
<p>
The premise of this program is that extrinsic goals have replaced your intrinsic motives,
and your intrinsic motives have faded. That this happens is well established in the literature.</p>
<p>
What isn't known, because it hasn't been studied, is whether this situation
can be reversed. Hence this program.</p>
<p>It's 5 minutes of your time each morning for 30 days.</p>
<p>Try it, it's experimental, and if it doesn't work
you're no worse off than you were at the start.</p>

<!-- Slideshow ##################################################################################################### -->

<article id="SSDay1">
<h2>Welcome to motivation!</h2>
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<p>This is your first day.</p>
<p>
It starts with a slideshow, where words and images appear on the
screen. This takes about a minute, and uses
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming</a>
to get you to think about your project.</p>
<p>
During the slideshow, one of the words will stand out: it might be in
color, or a different position, or upside down, or outlined, or shaking... something
will be different and it will be easy to spot.</p>
<p>
After the slide show you will be asked to identify the standout word. If you didn't see which
word was emphasized you'll have to rewatch the slideshow.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('SSDay1a')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="SSDay1a">
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
When you've correctly identified the standout word, you'll be shown the lesson
text and maybe asked to do a small task.</p>
<p>
The lessons are short (less then 5 min), the tasks are simple,
and not all days have lessons, so the course shouldn't take up much of your time.</p>
<p>In fact, this first day doesn't have a lesson. Lessons start on day two.</p>
<p>
At the end of the course - after 30 days of running this program - you should have better
motivation to finish your project.</p>

<p>Running the course multiple times per day will result in a stronger effect</p>
<p class="CenterText">...but don't overdo it.</p>
<p>
Three times a day is good, but more than five is
probably too much.</p>
<p>Also, it's better to let some time elapse between runs. Running
the program once in the morning, afternoon, and night will be better than running
it three times in the morning.</p>
<p>Your brain needs to process and integrate the information, which usually happens during sleep.</p>

<!-- Two types of motivation ####################################################################################### -->

<article id="TWA00">
<h2>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</h2>
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations are what you get for completing a project, such as money, fame, encouragement,
likes, subscribers, or avoiding punishment. They are the rewards you get in exchange for being done.</p>
<p>
<b>Intrinsic</b> motivations come from the project itself, and there are four types:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Autonomy</span> - You decide what to do</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you&nbsp;re rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('TWA01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="TWA01">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>routine, repetitive</em> tasks - things you can do automatically,
without a lot of thought or planning.<br>&nbsp;<br>
For example, a dealership auto mechanic spends his day diagnosing
and fixing one brand of cars. The procedures are well known, require little thought or
choice, and the paycheck is his extrinsic reward.</p>
<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>creative</em> tasks.<br>&nbsp;<br>
If that same mechanic works at home on a project race car, he has
intrinsic motivations:</p>
<ul class="NoSpc">
<li>He chooses what to do, and how to do it.</li>
<li>He learns about a different class of vehicle</li>
<li>He does a good job, and the car looks good</li>
<li>He wants to start racing</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on his a project car, the mechanic gains a deep sense of satisfaction.<br>&nbsp;<br>
He enjoys the process.</p>

<article id="TWA02">
<h2>Homework:</h2>
<p>
Before the next course day, when you get a moment, think about your project and choose the
intrinsic motivation your project is weakest on.</p>
<p>
Don't spend a lot of time on this, just think about the question when you have spare moments.
Have your choice ready for the next lesson.</p>
<p>For reference, the intrinsic motivations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Autonomy</span> - You make the decisions</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader Wid9">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>

<h2>Decreasing motivation</h2>
<p>Extrinsic motivations will decrease the intrinsic motivations.</p>
<p>
In one study, nursery school students were given markers and encouraged to draw pictures
during their free play time, an activity for which they had high intrinsic interest.</p>
<p>
Several weeks later, students in one group were given a “good player”
award with a ribbon and gold star for drawing, while students in the control group were simply
encouraged to draw for fun.
Several weeks after that, both groups were monitored when the markers were brought out

In another study, two groups of college students were asked to perform
activities that they already found interesting: solving puzzles and writing newspaper headlines.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the study, both groups performed the activity with no rewards.</p>
<p>In the second phase, one group was paid for the activity, while the second group acted as a control.</p>
<p>In the third phase, both groups once again performed the activity with no rewards.</p>
<p>
Students who were paid during the second phase were less likely to continue the
activities in the third phase. Students who were not paid were more likely to continue.</p>

Both groups started out equally interested, but the extrinsic reward reduced the motivation
for one group.</p>

<h2>The Overjustification Effect</h2>
<p>
This is called the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect">
overjustification effect</a>.</p>
<p>
Essentially, your mind notices being rewarded for an activity, and assumes
this is the reason you're doing it. Extrinsic motivations replace your 
intrinsic ones, and the intrinsic motivations fade.</p>
<p>But then, the extrinsic rewards only come when the project is complete...</p>
<p>
So with no intrinsic motivation to sustain you, making progress on your projects
becomes a boring drudgery. You lose interest over time, and eventually give up.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble finishing your projects, probably your
intrinsic motivations have been replaced with extrinsic ones, leaving no
motivation to sustain you while working on your project.</p>
<p>You'll need to fix that.</p>

rewards in a separate section below.</p>

<h2>Actions can change Beliefs</h2>
<p>Your actions can change your beliefs.</p>
<p>In one study researchers had two groups perform a boring
task for an hour. Subjects from the first group were then asked to convince
another person (an actor) that the task was interesting and engaging, while 
the second group acted as a control.</p>
<p>
Curiously, subjects who tried to convince a third person that the task was
actually interesting rated the tasks less boring than the subjects in the
control group.</p>

how they acted, and changed beliefs to make a more consistent self image.</p>
<p>
Your brain tries to maintain a concordant self-image. When your actions aren't
consistent with your beliefs, your mind will change beliefs to match your actions.

Phrase it in terms of what you <em>will</em> do, instead of what you won't.

You can also try switching motivations. This can work if a long, boring task
comes in the middle. When you reach the boring task, switch from intrinsic motivations
to extrinsic ones.</p>
<p>
Promise yourself a reward for successful completion: go out to dinner, eat a bowl of ice cream,
take a walk in the park - whatever you enjoy, use that as a reward for finishing the
boring section.</p>
<p>
Keep your task motivations separate. Any overlap between the rewards and
the enjoyment will reduce your enjoyment.</p>
<p>
Be clear with yourself that the rewards are for completing the task, and not for
the entire project. Think about the rest of the project in terms of intrinsic enjoyment.</p>

<h2>The neurochemistry of motivation</h2>
<p>
Knowing the neurochemistry of motivation can help. Knowing how things work and how they
interrelate will help you make informed decisions about your motivation.</p>
<p>
The next few lessons describe, in broad terms, how the brain manages motivation
using neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors.</p>
<p>
The scientific literature for neurochemistry has changed since the author learned it
10 years ago. It's also wildly complex, and there's no consensus.</p>
<p>
What follows is believed to be accurate for <em>what</em> happens and can be used
for illustration and planning, but the names might be wrong.</p>

<article id="NCA01">
<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>
<p>Neurotransmitters are chemicals that one neuron uses to signal another. </p>
<p class="NoTop">
This happens at a special point called a synapse, where one neuron
almost touches another. When the neuron wants to send a signal, it
releases neurotransmitter molecules at the synapse, which diffuse to the
other neuron and bind to corresponding receptors.</p>
<div>
<img class="BigImageLeft" alt="Synapse diagram" src="images/Synapse.gif">
<div class="RightText1">
<br>
It's sort of like ringing a desk bell. Sending neurotransmitter molecules
through the synapse alerts the target neuron.<br>&nbsp;<br>
After the signal is delivered, the molecules drift back to the source neuron
where they are collected and stored for future signaling.

More than 100 neurotransmitters are used in the brain, but we only need to know
about three: norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The brain uses these for effort, enjoyment, and reward.</p>
<br>
<table class="CenterDiv"><tbody>
<tr>
    <td>Norepinephrine</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

<h2>Norepinephrine is effort</h2>
<p>The first neurotransmitter of interest is norepinephrine, the neurotransmitter of effort.</p>
<p>
You may have heard of epinephrine, also known as adrenaline (two words for the same
substance). It's the chemical in
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epinephrine_autoinjector">EpiPens</a>
used to treat severe allergic reaction.</p>
<p>
Epinephrine is released when you're afraid or angry, and
causes your heart to race, your blood pressure to
rise, and releases glucose into the blood for quick energy.
Epinephrine/Adrenaline prepares your body (and mind) for a jolt of activity:
fight or flight, something you might have to do to survive.</p>
<p>
Nor-epinephrine, also known as
nor-adrenaline (again: two words, same substance),
is a weaker version used for day-to-day actions. Eact time you decide
to do (or not to do) something, your brain uses norepinephrine/noradrenaline.</p>
<p>If you've heard the expression "burning the candle at both ends", nor-epinephrine is
like burning a candle, and epinephrine is like burning rocket fuel.</p>

<h2>The effort counter</h2>
<p>
When your brain decides to act, it releases norepinephrine and starts a
counter that monitors the amount used for the task.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
When the counter exceeds a threshold limit, it will generate frustration,
irritation, dissatisfaction, and annoyance to encourage the brain to stop.</p>
<p>Here are two tasks showing the epinephrine counter.</p>
<div>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<img class="BigImageLeft" alt="Epinephrine counter diagram" src="images/NorEpi.png">
<div class="RightText1">
<p>
The first task is complex, requiring many decisions. Eventually, the total
norepinephrine exceeds the counter limit, resulting in frustration and annoyance.
The brain tires of the task, and quits before reaching the goal.</p>
<p>
The second task is less demanding. Requiring fewer and easier decisions, the
goal is reached before the counter limit is reached.</p>

make things easier?</p>

<h2>Dopamine is enjoyment</h2>

<h2>Leaving things undone</h2>
<p>
One way to make starting easier is to leave something undone.</p>
<p>
Writers sometimes do this. Instead of taking a break when a chapter is finished,
they stop a half page <em>before</em> the end of a chapter, or after
the first page of the <em>next</em> chapter.</p>
<p>
When they sit down again, the next paragraphs are obvious, the
dopamine kicks in, and they continue.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble starting on your project, try leaving something
undone in the previous session. Install all the bolts except one, don't sew
the last hem, leave 1 component unplaced on the board layout, and so on.</p>

<h2>Serotonin is reward</h2>
<p>The third neurotransmitter (of three) is serotonin, which the
brain uses for changes in predicted reward.</p>
<p>
If a distant uncle suddenly passes leaving you his fortune, your
brain will release serotonin to cause a release of
dopamine, which will make you happy.</p>
<p>
If your elderly uncle is terminal, in hospice, and it's only a matter of time -
in that case his passing is solemn and his legacy is received with somber respect.
</p>
<p>
Serotonin increases your dopamine when something unexpectedly favorable happens, 
and decreases it when something unexpectedly bad happens.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The full term for the action of serotonin is "dopamine reward prediction error".</p>
<p>When you consider an action, the brain looks forward in time and
predicts the reward for achieving that goal. Serotonin causes
a dopamine release for that predicted reward.</p>
<p>Once the goal is reached, the actual reward is compared to the predicted
reward: if extra reward is seen, serotonin releases more dopamine
saying, in effect, "next time have a more positive outlook".</p>
<p>If less reward than predicted is seen, serotonin causes dopamine to be
withheld, reducing future predictions.</p>
<p>
Serotonin is the feedback signal that teaches us to make accurate
predictions.</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<p>
Serotonin is a differential signal: it responds to a perceived
<em>difference</em> in value.</p>
<p>
A pay raise will make you happy for a time because the extra reward is
different from what you used to get, but
the feeling soon fades. A year later the perceived value is the same
as the day before, and will be the same a day later, and now you're
looking for another pay raise.</p>
<p>
Studies show that a year after winning the lottery, most people return to
the level of happiness they had before winning.</p>
<p>
Winning spikes their serotonin, which increases their dopamine, and
results in feelings of joy. A year later, the perceived value is the
same as it was the previous day, the same as predicted for the next day,
and no serotonin is released. The dopamine from the win has faded,
and they've returned to their original level of happiness.

<h2>Faded motivation</h2>

If you start a project and have to order parts online, when the parts arrive 
you may find you've lost interest.</p>

This is the root cause of the "startup" issue mentioned in the previous

<!-- Failure ####################################################################################################### -->

<article id="FAI00">
<h2>Ignoring Failure</h2>
<p>Thomas Edison made over 10,000 failed attempts before he got a working light bulb.</p>
<p>
When asked by a reporter how it felt to fail 10,000 times, Edison replied:
“I didn't fail 10,000 times, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that will not work.”</p>
<p>
This lesson isn't about motivation <em>now</em>, it's
about keeping motivation when you encounter a failure.</p>
<p>
Imagining future failures can minimize their impact.
Also, thinking about failure can encourage taking steps to avoid it.</p>
<p>
Note the word "when" and not "if" above. It's a near certainty
that you'll encounter failure at some point, and getting properly
oriented beforehand will help.</p>
<p>The term for this is

<article id="FAI01">
<p>So then, how should we handle failure?</p>
<p>
First, note that failure comes at the end of a project, or perhaps causes the end.
If you're still trying, if there's still a way it might work, then you haven't failed.</p>
<p>
Next, in almost all cases failure is a stepping stone to success. There are innumerable
examples of people failing repeatedly, only to succeed in the end. Thomas Edison is
an extreme example (10,000 tries? Yikes!), but the principle happens everywhere.</p>
<p>And finally, even when a project fails, is it a complete failure?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you learn anything new?</li>
<li>Did you improve your technique?</li>
<li>Can you salvage something useful for another project?</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's extremely rare for a project to fail completely. In nearly all cases
there is still value in having made the journey.</p>

<h2>Flow States</h2>
<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">flow state</a>
is when you're doing something and you lose track of time. Many people experience flow states while driving:
you're thinking about something, turning over a problem in your mind, and arrive at your
destination with no memory of driving or of the passage of time.</p>
<p>
Some people experience flow states in their projects. They sit down to work, get caught up in the
activity, and look up hours later wondering where the time went.</p>
<p>
Flow states are enjoyable, and the enjoyment builds the longer you are in the state. When you enter
flow, it's as if your brain starts a counter, and the higher the count the more pleasure you
get. When you stop working, the counter resets to zero, and if you restart your counter needs to
build back up before you can get a similar level enjoyment.</p>
<p>
The flow state counter will reset every time you stop working, so for maximum pleasure you can
seek to avoid interruptions and breaks while in a flow state.</p>

<p>
One curious result from psychological studies is that cognition is a limited resource.</p>
<p>
It's as if you wake up each morning with a gas tank full of cognitive ability, and throughout the day
every action you take and every decision you make uses up a little bit of it.</p>
<p>
During sleep, your gas tank fills up so that, hopefully, you wake up refreshed, with a full tank.</p>

physically tired. Your cognitive gas tank is sitting at empty, and all you want to do is veg out

It's OK to feel exhausted at the end of the day occasionally - we're probably evolved for that -
but if you're feeling exhausted every evening then that should be fixed. Constant mental exhaustion
is the same as constant mental stress (it uses the same neurotransmitters), and this causes incremental
damage.</p>
<p>
It causes depression, reduces your immune function, and leads to all sorts of problems later
in life.</p>

<p>
Norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter that gets you going, and dopamine is released when you
are on the right path. The word "path" is appropriate because the NE circuit evolved to
get us walking towards our goal.</p>
<p>
Our ancestors  needed food, shelter, or safety which were found at different places, and the
neurotransmitters act to get us there.</p>
<p>
Since this is the mechanism that makes working on projects enjoyable, we can strengthen
the effect by framing our projects as a journey.

We can link our projects more strongly to this mechanism by describing our project as a journey.</p>

<p id="Shoes">
<em>For my money, there was never a better shoe than the Anaheim sneaker.
Whatever the surface or the size of the arena, any time a short-sided
game crept up, you would find me wearing Anaheims. Mid-rise collar for stability
and a natural fit for small feet, elastic laces and hook & loop closure made
it easy to get on and off. Traction, cushioning, and the overall feel
provided excellent grip on any surface.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The biggest issue for me was an odd fit/looseness in the heel. 
This happened every time I put the shoes on, but it went away
after a few minutes of use.</em></p>
