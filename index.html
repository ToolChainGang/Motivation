<h2>Welcome to motivation!</h2>
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<p>This is your first lesson day.</p>
<p>
It starts with a slideshow, where words and images appear on the
screen. This takes about a minute, and uses
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming</a>
to get you to think about your project.</p>
<p>
During the slideshow, one of the words will be emphasized: it might be in
color, or a different position, or upside down, or outlined, or shaking... something
will be different and it will be easy to spot.</p>
<p>
After the slide show you will be asked to identify the emphasized word. If you didn't see which
word was emphasized you'll have to rewatch the slideshow.</p>

<article id="SSDay1a">
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
When you've correctly identified the emphasized word, you'll be shown the lesson
text and maybe asked to do a small task.</p>
<p>
The texts are short (less then 5 min), the tasks are simple,
and not all days have lessons, so the course shouldn't take up much of your time.</p>
<p>
At the end of the course - after 30 days of running this program - you should have better
motivation to finish your project.</p>

but don't overdo it. Three times a day is good, but more than five is
probably too much. Also, it's better to let some time elapse between runs. Running
the program once in the morning, afternoon, and night will be better than running
it three times in the morning.</p>

<!-- Two types of motivation ####################################################################################### -->

<article id="TWA00">
<h2>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</h2>
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations are what you get for completing a project, such as money, fame, encouragement,
likes, subscribers, or avoiding punishment. They are the rewards you get in exchange for being done.</p>
<p>
<b>Intrinsic</b> motivations come from the project itself, and there are four types:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You decide what to do</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('TWA01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="TWA01">
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>routine, repetitive</em> tasks - things you can do automatically,
without a lot of thought or planning.</p>
<p>
For example, a dealership auto mechanic spends his day diagnosing
and fixing a specific brand of cars. The procedures are well known, require little thought or
choice, and the paycheck is his extrinsic reward.</p>
<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>creative</em> tasks.</p>
<p>If that same mechanic goes home to work on a project race car, he has
intrinsic motivations:</p>
<ul class="NoSpc">
<li>He chooses what to do, and how to do it.</li>
<li>He learns about a different class of vehicle</li>
<li>He does a good job, and the car looks good</li>
<li>He wants to start racing</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on his a project car, the mechanic gains a deep sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>He enjoys the process.</p>

<article id="TWA02">
<h2>Homework:</h2>
<p>
Before the next course day, when you get a moment, think about your project and choose the
intrinsic motivation your project is weakest on.</p>
<p>
Don't spend a lot of time on this, just think about the question when you have spare moments.
Have your choice ready for the next lesson.</p>
<p>For reference, the intrinsic motivations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You make the decisions</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>

<h2>Decreasing motivation</h2>
<p>Having extrinsic motivations will decrease the intrinsic motivations.</p>
<p>
In one study, nursery school students were given markers and encouraged to draw pictures
during their free play time, an activity for which they had high intrinsic interest.</p>
<p>
Several weeks later, students in one group were given a “good player”
award with a ribbon and gold star for drawing, while students in the control group were simply
encouraged to draw for fun.</p>
<p>
Several weeks after that, both groups were monitored when the markers were brought out
during playtime.</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, the children who had been given an extrinsic reward showed far less interest in drawing
than the children who were not offered the reward.</p>
<p>Something about the reward reduced the children’s desire to draw.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('TWC01')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="TWC01">
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
In another study, two groups of college students were asked to perform
activities that they already found interesting: solving puzzles and writing newspaper headlines.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the study, both groups performed the activity with no rewards.</p>
<p>In the second phase, one group was paid for the activity, while the second group acted as a control.</p>
<p>In the third phase, both groups once again performed the activity with no rewards.</p>
<p>
Students who were paid during the second phase were less likely to continue the
activities in the third phase. Students who were not paid were more likely to continue.</p>
<p>
Both groups started out equally interested, but the extrinsic reward reduced the motivation
for one group.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
This is called the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect">
overjustification effect</a>.</p>
<p>
Essentially, your mind notices you're being rewarded for an activity, and assumes
this is the reason you're doing it. Extrinsic motivations replace the 
intrinsic ones, and your intrinsic motivations fade away.</p>
<p>But then, the extrinsic rewards only come when the project is complete...</p>
<p>
So with no intrinsic motivation to sustain you, making progress on your projects
becomes a boring drudgery. You lose interest over time, and eventually give up.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble finishing your projects, it's probably because your
intrinsic motivations have been replaced with extrinsic ones, leaving you no
motivation to sustain you while working on your project.</p>
<p>You'll need to fix that.</p>

<h2>Defining your motivations</h2>
<p>
To refocus on intrinsic motivations, start by writing them down.</p>
<p>
On a piece of paper, write all the motivations you have for doing your project.</p>
<p>Put the internal motivations in four sections at the top, and keep the external
rewards in a separate section below.</p>
<div>
<img class="ImageLeft" alt="Pad with motivations" src="images/PadFilled.gif">

<h2>Homework:</h2>
<p>
Keep your motivation list with you over the course of the day: in your wallet or
pocketbook, beside your monitor, or wherever's convenient.</p>
<p>
When you have spare moments,
think about the project and try to find other motivations or rewards. If you think
of any new ones, add them to the list.</p>
<p>
Keep the intrinsic motives at the top, and the rewards at the bottom, though.
You'll see why at the next lesson.</p>

<h2>The concordant self image</h2>
<p>Your actions can change your opinions.</p>
<p>In one study researchers asked students to perform a boring task for an hour.
Once the hour was up, the researchers asked half to try to convince
another person (an actor) that the task was interesting and engaging.</p>
<p>
Curiously, the subjects who tried to convince a third person that the task was
actually interesting rated the tasks less boring than the subjects in the
control group.</p>
<p>
Their brains noticed a disconnect between their beliefs and actions, and
changed their opinions to make their self image consistent with their actions.</p>

<p>
In a second study, when participants were asked to give an impromptu speech supporting
an opinion they disagree with, their private opinion moves closer to the opinion in the
speech.</p>
<p>
Again, it seems that their brains noticed the disconnect between what they believed and
what they did, and their brains changed to make a more consistent self image.</p>
<p>
We can use this effect to change how your brain sees your project motivations.</p>

<h2>The neurochemistry of motivation</h2>

<p>
Knowing the neurochemistry of motivation can help. Knowing how things work and how they interrelate can help
you make changes that will work, instead of making changes based on guesswork.</p>
<p>
The following pages describe, in broad terms, how the brain manages motivation using neurotransmitters
and neuroreceptors. We start with a quick overview of these concepts.</p>
<p>
If you already know about neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors, feel free to skip the overview and begin
with the section on motivation.</p>
<p>
If you don't know what neurotransmitters are, or you would like a refresher, start with that section: it will
lead you to the motivation section after.</p>

<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>

<p>Neurotransmitters are just chemicals that one neuron uses to signal another neuron. </p>
<p>
This signalling happens at a special point called a "synapse" on the neuron body - it's a place where the
body of one neuron almost touches the body of another. Whenever one neuron wants to signal another, it releases
neurotransmitter molecules at the synapse junction. The molecules diffuse over to the other neuron and bind to the
corresponding receptor, sending a signal that excites the target neuron.</p>
<p>
It's sort of like the bell at a hotel desk. Sending neurotransmitters through the synapse is like ringing
a bell: it gets the attention of the target neuron.</p>
<p>
Once the signal is delivered, the receptor releases the neurotransmitters. The molecules diffuse back
to the originating neuron, where they are collected and stored for future signaling.</p>

<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>
<p>
There are over 100 neurotransmitters used in the brain, but for our purposes we only need to know
about three: NorEpinephrine, Dopamine, and Serotonin, which are responsible for activity, pleasure,
and reward.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('NCA03')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="NCA03">
<p>Before we begin, we need to sort out some nomenclature.</p>
<p>
Adrenaline and Epinephrine are two names for the same chemical. It was discovered independently
by two laboratories at about the same time.
NorEpinephrine and NorAdrenaline are two names for a different chemical. It was
discovered by the same laboratories at about the same time.</p>
<p>
Epinephrine and NorEpinephrine are the names used in the US, while Adrenaline and NorAdrenaline are
used in the UK. Across the rest of the world different countries use one term or the other.</p>
<p>Such is the way of science.</p>
<p>
For the rest of the course, this program will use both terms with a slash between the
equivalent names. Epinephrine/Adrenaline will be the "fight-or-flight" neurotransmitter, and
NorEpinephrine/NorAdrenaline will be the "action" neurotransmitter.</p>

<h2>NorEpinephrine/NorAdrenaline, the neurotransmitter of action</h2>
<p>
Adrenaline/Epinephrine prepares your body (and mind) for a jolt of activity:
fight or flight, something you might have to do to survive.</p>
<p>
NorAdrenaline/NorEpinephrine is a weaker version that's used for day-to-day decision
making. Every time you decide to do something (or not to do something), your brain uses
a little bit of Adrenaline/Epinephrine to start the action.</p>
<p>You may have heard the expression "burning the candle at both ends".</p>
<p>
If NorAdrenaline/NorEpinephrine is like burning a candle, Adrenaline/Epinephrine
is like burning rocket fuel.</p>

<!-- Failure ####################################################################################################### -->

<article id="FAI00">
<h2>Ignore Failure</h2>
<p>Thomas Edison had over 10,000 failed attempts before he got a working light bulb.</p>
<p>
When asked by a reporter how it felt to fail 10,000 times, Edison replied:
“I didn't fail 10,000 times, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that will not work.”</p>
<p>
This lesson isn't about getting more motivation <em>now</em>, it's
about keeping motivation when you encounter a failure.</p>
<p>
Imagining future failures can minimize their impact.
Also, thinking about failure can encourage taking steps to avoid it.</p>
<p>
Notice we said "when" and not "if". It's a near certainty
that you'll encounter failure at some point, so getting properly
oriented will help.</p>
<p>The term for this is
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospection">"prospection"</a>.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('FAI01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="FAI01">
<p>So then, how should we handle failure?</p>
<p>
First, note that failure comes at the end of a project, or perhaps causes the end.
If you're still trying, if there's still a way it might work, then you haven't failed.</p>
<p>
Next, in almost all cases failure is a stepping stone to success. There are innumerable
examples of people failing repeatedly, only to succeed in the end. Thomas Edison is
an extreme example (10,000 tries? Yikes!), but the principle happens everywhere.</p>
<p>And finally, even when a project fails, is it a complete failure?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you learn anything new?</li>
<li>Did you improve your technique?</li>
<li>Can you salvage something useful for another project?</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's extremely rare for a project ro fail completely. In nearly all cases
there is still value in having made the journey.</p>

<h2>Flow States</h2>
<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">flow state</a>
is when you're doing something and you lose track of time. Many people experience flow states while driving
- you're thinking about something, turning over a problem in your mind, and arrive at your
destination without any memory of driving or of the passage of time.</p>
<p>
Some people experience flow states in their projects. They sit down to work, get caught up in the
activity, and look up hours later wondering where the time went.</p>
<p>
Flow states are enjoyable, and the enjoyment builds the longer you are in the state. When you enter
flow, it's as if your brain starts a counter, and the higher the count the more pleasure you
get. When you stop working, the counter resets to zero, and if you restart your counter needs to
build back up before you can get a similar level enjoyment.</p>
<p>
The flow state counter will reset every time you stop working, so for maximum pleasure you can
seek to avoid interruptions and breaks while in a flow state.</p>

<h2>The Cognitive Gas Tank</h2>
<p>
One curious result from psychological studies is that cognition is a limited resource.</p>
<p>
It's as if you wake up each morning with a gas tank full of cognitive ability, and throughout the day
every action you take and every decision you make uses up a little bit of it.</p>
<p>
During sleep, your gas tank fills up so that, hopefully, you wake up refreshed, with a full tank.</p>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('COG01')">Continue ›</a></p>

<article id="COG01">
<p>
Studies show that it's possible to drain your cognition completely, and when that happens you lose
the ability to make rational decisions.</p>
<p>
This explains how you can come home at night and feel exhausted, even though you know you're not
physically tired. Your cognitive gas tank is sitting at empty, and all you want to do is veg out
in front of the T.V.</p>

<p>
It's OK to feel exhausted at the end of the day occasionally - we're probably evolved for that -
but if you're feeling exhausted every evening then that should be fixed. Constant mental exhaustion
is the same as constant mental stress (it uses the same neurotransmitters), and this causes incremental
damage.</p>
<p>
It causes depression, reduces your immune function, and leads to all sorts of problems later
in life.</p>
<p>
It's sort of like smoking. The damage from a single cigarette probably won't affect your health
appreciably, but smoking continually over several years and the damage will add up.</p>
