<h2>Welcome to Motivation!</h2>
<p>
Many people have difficulty bringing their projects to completion.</p>
<p>They get excited at first, but the excitement soon fades, and the
project languishes for lack of time.</p>
<p>
Then you get a new idea that seems wonderful and exciting, but in a little
while this new excitement also fades, and now you have two projects
languishing for lack of time.</p>
<p>Rinse, and repeat.</p>
<p>
Over time, the end result is that many people have several, perhaps dozens, of projects
that they recognize as valuable, and would "really like" to get back into, but they
never seem to have the time or motivation to do so.</p>

This program uses psychological methods to increase your motivation for completing projects.
Run it once a day for 30 days, and you should see an improvement in project motivation.</p>
<p>
Each run consists of a one-minute slideshow of words and images that bring your project to mind,
plus a short lesson on some psychological aspect of motivation.</p>
<p>
The slideshow gets your mind thinking about the project, and the lessons help you make
small changes to your behavior and attitude that should boost your project motivation.</p>
<p>
The techniques are well documented and backed by scientific studies, no tricks or subliminal
messaging is involved. A full description of the techniques is included under the "Methods"
link on the main page.</p>

<!-- Slideshow ##################################################################################################### -->

<article id="SSDay1">
<h2>Welcome to motivation!</h2>
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<p>This is your first day.</p>
<p>
It starts with a slideshow, where words and images appear on the
screen. This takes about a minute, and uses
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)">priming</a>
to get you to think about your project.</p>
<p>
During the slideshow, one of the words will stand out: it might be in
color, or a different position, or upside down, or outlined, or shaking... something
will be different and it will be easy to spot.</p>
<p>
After the slide show you will be asked to identify the standout word. If you didn't see which
word was emphasized you'll have to rewatch the slideshow.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('SSDay1a')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="SSDay1a">
<h3 class="DayBanner">Day $DAY of $MAXDAY</h3>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
When you've correctly identified the standout word, you'll be shown the lesson
text and maybe asked to do a small task.</p>
<p>
The texts are short (less then 5 min), the tasks are simple,
and not all days have lessons, so the course shouldn't take up much of your time.</p>
<p>In fact, this first day doesn't have a lesson. Lessons start on day two.</p>
<p>
At the end of the course - after 30 days of running this program - you should have better
motivation to finish your project.</p>

<p>
Three times a day is good, but more than five is
probably too much.</p>
<p>Also, it's better to let some time elapse between runs. Running
the program once in the morning, afternoon, and night will be better than running
it three times in the morning.</p>
<p>Your brain needs to process and integrate the information, which usually happens during sleep.</p>

<!-- Two types of motivation ####################################################################################### -->

<article id="TWA00">
<h2>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</h2>
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations are what you get for completing a project, such as money, fame, encouragement,
likes, subscribers, or avoiding punishment. They are the rewards you get in exchange for being done.</p>
<p>
<b>Intrinsic</b> motivations come from the project itself, and there are four types:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You decide what to do</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>
</ul>
<p><a class="Cont" title="Continue" onclick="NavID('TWA01')">Continue ›</a></p>
</article>

<article id="TWA01">
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>routine, repetitive</em> tasks - things you can do automatically,
without a lot of thought or planning.</p>
<p>
For example, a dealership auto mechanic spends his day diagnosing
and fixing a specific brand of cars. The procedures are well known, require little thought or
choice, and the paycheck is his extrinsic reward.</p>
<p><b>Intrinsic</b> motivations work well for <em>creative</em> tasks.</p>
<p>If that same mechanic goes home to work on a project race car, he has
intrinsic motivations:</p>
<ul class="NoSpc">
<li>He chooses what to do, and how to do it.</li>
<li>He learns about a different class of vehicle</li>
<li>He does a good job, and the car looks good</li>
<li>He wants to start racing</li>
</ul>

<p>While working on his a project car, the mechanic gains a deep sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>He enjoys the process.</p>

<h2>Homework:</h2>
<p>
Before the next course day, when you get a moment, think about your project and choose the
intrinsic motivation your project is weakest on.</p>
<p>
Don't spend a lot of time on this, just think about the question when you have spare moments.
Have your choice ready for the next lesson.</p>
<p>For reference, the intrinsic motivations are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You make the decisions</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>

<h2>Decreasing motivation</h2>
<p>Having extrinsic motivations will decrease the intrinsic motivations.</p>
<p>
In one study, nursery school students were given markers and encouraged to draw pictures
during their free play time, an activity for which they had high intrinsic interest.</p>
<p>
Several weeks later, students in one group were given a “good player”
award with a ribbon and gold star for drawing, while students in the control group were simply
encouraged to draw for fun.</p>
<p>
Several weeks after that, both groups were monitored when the markers were brought out
during playtime. Surprisingly, the children who had been given an extrinsic reward showed
far less interest in drawing than the children who were not offered the reward.</p>
<p>Something about the reward reduced the children’s desire to draw.</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>
In another study, two groups of college students were asked to perform
activities that they already found interesting: solving puzzles and writing newspaper headlines.</p>
<p>In the first phase of the study, both groups performed the activity with no rewards.</p>
<p>In the second phase, one group was paid for the activity, while the second group acted as a control.</p>
<p>In the third phase, both groups once again performed the activity with no rewards.</p>
<p>
Students who were paid during the second phase were less likely to continue the
activities in the third phase. Students who were not paid were more likely to continue.</p>
<p>
Both groups started out equally interested, but the extrinsic reward reduced the motivation
for one group.</p>

<h2>The Overjustification Effect</h2>
<p>
This is called the 
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect">
overjustification effect</a>.</p>
<p>
Essentially, your mind notices being rewarded for an activity, and assumes
this is the reason you're doing it. Extrinsic motivations replace your 
intrinsic ones, and the intrinsic motivations fade away.</p>
<p>But then, the extrinsic rewards only come when the project is complete...</p>
<p>
So with no intrinsic motivation to sustain you, making progress on your projects
becomes a boring drudgery. You lose interest over time, and eventually give up.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble finishing your projects, it's probably because your
intrinsic motivations have been replaced with extrinsic ones, leaving no

<h2>Defining your motivations</h2>
<p>
To refocus on intrinsic motivations, start by writing them down.</p>
<p>
On a piece of paper, write all the motivations you have for doing your project.</p>
<p>Put the internal motivations in four sections at the top, and keep the external
rewards in a separate section below.</p>

why this is so.<br>

<h2>Homework:</h2>
<p>
Keep your motivation sheet with you today: in your wallet or
pocketbook, beside your monitor, or wherever's convenient.</p>
<p>
When you have spare moments, think about your project and if you think
of any new motives, add them to the list.</p>
<p>
Keep the intrinsic motives at the top, and the rewards at the bottom, though.
You'll see why at the next lesson.</p>

<p>Your actions can change your beliefs.</p>
<p>In one study researchers had two groups perform a boring
task for an hour. Subjects from the first group then tried to convince
another person (an actor) that the task was interesting and engaging, while 
the second group acted as a control.</p>
<p>
Curiously, subjects who tried to convince a third person that the task was
actually interesting rated the tasks less boring than the subjects in the
control group.</p>

changed their beliefs to become consistent.</p>

how they acted, and changed beliefs to make a more consistent self image.</p>

Look over your motivation list and think of a mantra that will reinforce
your self-image. Something that speaks to you, something you like.</p>
<p>
Nothing long, just a couple of words. It can be generic,
such as "I enjoy the process", or specific to your project such as "I love
writing detective novels".</p>
<div>
<img class="ImageLeft" alt="Pad completed" src="images/PadMantra.gif">
<div class="RightText">
Use personal pronouns and put your verb in present tense. Starting with "I"
is typical.<br>&nbsp;<br>
A mantra should also be positive, in the logical sense. Don't say "I don't"
or "I won't", brains have a harder time with inverted logic.
Phrase it in terms of what you <em>will</em> do, instead of what you won't.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
‹- Hint: For a stronger effect, write it down.

<p>
Over the course of the next day as you have spare moments, recite
your mantra to yourself. Do this frequently, and try to

You might not find sanding and painting as interesting as the engine rebuild.</p>

You can also try switching motivations. This can work if a long, boring task
comes in the middle. When you reach the boring task, switch from intrinsic motivations
to extrinsic ones.</p>
<p>
Promise yourself a reward for successful completion: go out to dinner, eat a bowl of ice cream,
take a walk in the park - whatever you enjoy, use that as a reward for finishing the
boring section.</p>
<p>
Keep your task motivations separate. Any overlap between the rewards and
the enjoyment will reduce your enjoyment.</p>

Don't wait until the end of this course to continue your project - you'll get a stronger effect

<h2>The neurochemistry of motivation</h2>

<p>
Knowing the neurochemistry of motivation can help. Knowing how things work and how they interrelate can help
you make changes that will work, instead of making changes based on guesswork.</p>
<p>
The following pages describe, in broad terms, how the brain manages motivation using neurotransmitters
and neuroreceptors. We start with a quick overview of these concepts.</p>
<p>
If you already know about neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors, feel free to skip the overview and begin
with the section on motivation.</p>
<p>
If you don't know what neurotransmitters are, or you would like a refresher, start with that section: it will
lead you to the motivation section after.</p>

<h2>Neurotransmitters and neuroreceptors</h2>

<p>Neurotransmitters are chemicals that one neuron uses to signal another. </p>
<p class="NoTop">
This happens at a special point called a synapse, where one neuron
almost touches another. When the neuron wants to send a signal, it
releases neurotransmitter molecules at the synapse, which diffuse to the
other neuron and bind to corresponding receptors.</p>
<div>
<img class="BigImageLeft" alt="Synapse diagram" src="images/Synapse.gif">
<div class="RightText1">
<br>
It's sort of like ringing a desk bell. Sending neurotransmitters through the synapse
gets the attention of the target neuron.<br>&nbsp;<br>
After the signal is delivered, the molecules drift back to the source neuron
where they are collected and stored for future signaling.

NorAdrenaline/NorEpinephrine is a weaker version that's used for day-to-day decision
making. Every time you decide to do something (or not to do something), your brain uses
a little bit of Adrenaline/Epinephrine to start the action.</p>

<!-- Failure ####################################################################################################### -->

<article id="FAI00">
<h2>Ignore Failure</h2>
<p>Thomas Edison had over 10,000 failed attempts before he got a working light bulb.</p>
<p>
When asked by a reporter how it felt to fail 10,000 times, Edison replied:
“I didn't fail 10,000 times, I’ve just found 10,000 ways that will not work.”</p>
<p>
This lesson isn't about getting more motivation <em>now</em>, it's
about keeping motivation when you encounter a failure.</p>
<p>
Imagining future failures can minimize their impact.
Also, thinking about failure can encourage taking steps to avoid it.</p>
<p>
Notice we said "when" and not "if". It's a near certainty
that you'll encounter failure at some point, so getting properly
oriented will help.</p>
<p>The term for this is
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospection">"prospection"</a>.</p>

<article id="FAI01">
<p>So then, how should we handle failure?</p>
<p>
First, note that failure comes at the end of a project, or perhaps causes the end.
If you're still trying, if there's still a way it might work, then you haven't failed.</p>
<p>
Next, in almost all cases failure is a stepping stone to success. There are innumerable
examples of people failing repeatedly, only to succeed in the end. Thomas Edison is
an extreme example (10,000 tries? Yikes!), but the principle happens everywhere.</p>
<p>And finally, even when a project fails, is it a complete failure?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you learn anything new?</li>
<li>Did you improve your technique?</li>
<li>Can you salvage something useful for another project?</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's extremely rare for a project ro fail completely. In nearly all cases
there is still value in having made the journey.</p>

<h2>Flow States</h2>
<p>
A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)" target="_blank">flow state</a>
is when you're doing something and you lose track of time. Many people experience flow states while driving
- you're thinking about something, turning over a problem in your mind, and arrive at your
destination without any memory of driving or of the passage of time.</p>
<p>
Some people experience flow states in their projects. They sit down to work, get caught up in the
activity, and look up hours later wondering where the time went.</p>
<p>
Flow states are enjoyable, and the enjoyment builds the longer you are in the state. When you enter
flow, it's as if your brain starts a counter, and the higher the count the more pleasure you
get. When you stop working, the counter resets to zero, and if you restart your counter needs to
build back up before you can get a similar level enjoyment.</p>
<p>
The flow state counter will reset every time you stop working, so for maximum pleasure you can
seek to avoid interruptions and breaks while in a flow state.</p>

One curious result from psychological studies is that cognition is a limited resource.</p>

An example should make this clear. Read the following passage, then answer the
question on the next page.</p>
<p id="Shoes">
<em>For my money, there was never a better shoe than the Anaheim sneaker.
Whatever the surface or the size of the arena, any time a short-sided
game crept up, you would find me wearing Anaheims. Mid-rise collar for stability
and a natural fit for small feet, elastic laces and hook & loop closure made
it easy to get on and off. Traction, cushioning, and the overall feel
provided excellent grip on any surface.<br>&nbsp;<br>
The biggest issue for me was an odd fit/looseness in the heel. 
This happened every time I put the shoes on, but it went away
after a few minutes of use.</em></p>
<p>
Hint: It helps to read the passage aloud. See if you can discover
it's odd nature.</p>

<p>
Think of a 4-letter word beginning with S, O, L.</p>
<p>
When you have one, type a letter to enter your word.</p>

Probability of English words:<br>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="ProbWords">
"SOLD": 0.00493391% (about once every&nbsp;&nbsp;20200 words)<br>
"SOLE": 0.00271912% (about once every&nbsp;&nbsp;36700 words)<br>
"SOLO": 0.00017536% (about once every&nbsp;570200 words)<br>
<br>

</div>
<p>
People typically guess "SOLD", since it is the most common.</p>
<p>
Surprisingly, people who first read the shoe passage often answer "SOLE".
The paragraph primes other shoe related concepts in the brain,
even though "SOLE" did not appear in the paragraph, even as a substring.</p>
<p>Priming activated the related concept.</p>
<p>
You are now primed. Shoe related items are now emphasized in your brain, and
this will affect your decisions and actions until the effect wears off.</p>

Priming fades with time, but there is no consensus for how long it lasts. Some
studies claim it decays over a few hours, but others have shown a small effect
measurable a week after the original stimulus.</p>
<p>
There are also different types of priming, and it is not known if the different types
have different durations.</p>
<p>
The slideshow uses priming to get your mind thinking about the project.</p>
<p>
We show images and words related to your project, and repeat this daily over the
course of the program.

You can find out more about this on the internet. The Wikipedia page on priming is a good
place to start.</p>

<h2>Extrinsic and intrinsic motivation</h2>
<p>
<b>Extrinsic</b> motivations are what you get for completing a project, such as money, fame, encouragement,
likes, subscribers, or avoiding punishment. They are the rewards you get in exchange for being done.</p>
<p>
<b>Intrinsic</b> motivations come from the project itself, and there are four types:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Autonomy</span> - You decide what to do</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Growth</span>   - You learn something new, or practice something you're rusty at</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Excellence</span> - You do a good job</li>
<li><span class="ListHeader" style="width: 9ch;">Usefulness</span> - The project is valuable to you, your family, or the community</li>

<h2>The Overjustification Effect</h2>
<p>
The
<a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overjustification_effect">
overjustification effect</a> is when your mind notices being rewarded for an activity,
and assumes this is the reason you're doing it. Extrinsic motivations replace your 
intrinsic ones, and the intrinsic motivations fade away.</p>

<p>Your brain maintains a concordant self-image.</p>
<p>
When your brain notices a

discrepancy between your beliefs and your actions</a>, it will
change beliefs to become consistent.</p>
